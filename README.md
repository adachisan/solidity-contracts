# Solidity smart contracts

`Personal collection of Solidity smart contracts. `

Solidity is a programming language used for creating contracts on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains.
These smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically perform functions when requested.

This repository includes various types of contracts such as token contracts, staking contracts, betting contracts, and more.
These contracts can be used for different purposes such as automating business processes, creating digital assets, providing decentralized services, and much more.

Having a personal collection of smart contracts can be useful for developers working on projects as it allows them to reuse and improve existing smart contracts for their own needs.
Additionally, a personal collection can be shared with other developers for collaboration or contribution to open-source projects.
